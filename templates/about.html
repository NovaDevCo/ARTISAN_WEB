        <h3>SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth</h3>
        <p>
          By providing local artists with a digital storefront, Likharyo directly supports artisans by giving them access
          to a wider market. Each purchase guarantees just compensation and sustains a traditional craft, promoting full
          and productive employment for Filipino creators.

        <h3>SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production</h3>
        <p>
          We encourage consumers to prefer locally manufactured goods. Our site uses shop narratives and product tags to
          highlight sustainable practices, such as the use of recycled materials or conventional methods, promoting
          conscious and sustainable consumption patterns.
